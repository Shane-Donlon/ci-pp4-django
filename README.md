Overall Plan Of Action:
Deploy early

Priority List:
Users will be the general public users for this site, and will house all the unauthenticated views.
User stories will be the first priority to get the public facing site up and running.

Moving on form user stories to the Ticket model next

Bee Keeper stories so that staff can update the tickets
Admin stories so that the admins can update the tickets.

Once all MVPs have been completed move onto the "Should haves"
Then "could haves"
Then "Won't haves"
